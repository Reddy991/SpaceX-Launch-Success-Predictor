Background + Context:

SpaceX is one of the world’s most advanced manufacturers of rockets and spacecrafts in their journey to make life multiplanetary. Part of the reason SpaceX is so successful is because they reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 spacecraft. Reusing this first stage makes it so that they can launch rockets and spacecrafts at a relatively low price compared to other competing companies. By analyzing the success rate of this first stage launch, we can determine if this method is ideal and if SpaceX should continue to use this model or change their strategy. As a competing company, we can also use some of their same methods if proven successful. 

What to look for?

- Success/fail rates of SpaceX launches and how different factors including payload mass, launch site, and flight type affect these rates
- Most successful predictive modeling methods
- What SpaceX has done to increase their success rates
